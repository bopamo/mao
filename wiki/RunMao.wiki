For each target you build MAO, a binary called {{{mao-$TARGET}}} will be placed in 
{{{./bin/.}}} Besides the normal flags accepted by GNU Assembler, the following can
be used.

{{{
Usage: mao [-mao_o FILE] [-mao_ir FILE] [-mao_v]
  -mao_o FILE       Prints output to FILE.
  -mao_ir FILE      Prints the IR in XML-like format to FILE
  -mao_v            Prints version and usage info, then exits
}}}

In order to read and print out assembly file example.s on a x86_64 target to 
stdout, run the following
