Project Structure:
The project is currently divided into two sections, a Test Generator, which 
generates assembly files to be ran, and a Runner, which uploads the assembly
files to a remote server, compiles them, and uses analysis tools to record
user-defined events related to execution.

Building the Test Generator:
The Test Generator is written in C++ and will be given a Makefile shortly,
but for now simply run the BuildTG.sh script.
# sh BuildTG.sh

Running the Test Generator:
# ./TestGenerator [--argument=value]
Currently two optional command line arguments are available to alter the
operation of the program:
  --instructions=
     - This argument specifies the number of instructions (currently add
       instructions for testing) to add to the output assembly file.
  --iterations=
     - This argument specifies the number of times to iterate of the 
       instructions added
Failure to supply either of these command line arguments results in that value
defaulting to 10,000.
The test generate will place all generated assembly files in a subdirectory
(Named with date and time) of the execution directory.

Running the Runner:
There are two runner scripts in the execution directory, but you need only run
the first, "runner.sh".
# sh runner.sh
You will be prompted for the name of the directory that the Test Generator
created and the pfmon events you would like to monitor.  Ignore any "X11 
forwarding denied" error messages, these will be dealt with in a later release.
The output from the Runner will be placed in a directory named identical to
that of the Test Generator output directory with "Results" appended.  Pfmon
output may be found in the files within that directory.
